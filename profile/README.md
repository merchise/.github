# What is Merchise?

The name "Merchise" has a long history.  The origin was a [computer software
group][wiki] created around 1991 at the Central University of Las Villas
(UCLV), in Cuba.

Several projects have existed in different parts of the world due to the
dispersion of the original members.  This organization on GitHub contains some
projects that are being developed to share the original spirit of this group.


## Other projects:

- A [technology company in Chile][chile].

- [Merchise Startup Circle][msc]: After relations between Cuba and The US were
  "restored", a movement was created for former members of the original group
  to develop technologies in Cuba using the Startups philosophy.  This was one
  of the projects [mentioned by President Obama][speech] at the Entrepreneurs
  Event in Cuba.  See also an [article in The New York Times][nyt] on the
  subject.

- [Merchise Autrement][ma]: A project originally based in Cuba, and now with
  members in several countries, focused on the development of business
  management technologies.
